Our market strategy is centered on disrupting the traditional banking sector by offering lower fees and better technology to underserved SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises). We focus primarily on the Brazilian and Latin American markets, which have high mobile penetration but fragmented payment ecosystems.

Key strategic goals include achieving 1 million active merchants by the end of the next fiscal year and expanding our credit product portfolio. Partnerships with local payment networks and e-commerce platforms are crucial for rapid growth.
