New employees begin their journey with a two-day virtual orientation session covering company history, culture, and core systems. The first 30 days are focused on meeting key stakeholders and understanding team goals.

Each new hire is assigned an onboarding buddy to assist with settling in. IT provisioning includes receiving a high-spec laptop and access credentials within the first week. By the end of 90 days, new hires are expected to have delivered their first independent project contribution.
