Our primary backend language is Go (Golang) for high-performance microservices, with some legacy services still running on Python. We use PostgreSQL as our main relational database and Redis for caching and session management.

All infrastructure is hosted on AWS, utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration (EKS). Front-end applications are built using React and TypeScript, ensuring scalability and maintainability. CI/CD pipelines are managed through GitHub Actions.
