The Q4 product roadmap focuses on three main initiatives: 1) Launching the enhanced B2B payment services, allowing merchants to pay suppliers directly from their InfiniteAccount. 2) Developing a physical debit card linked to the InfiniteAccount for global use. 3) Iterating on the InfinitePay Smart terminal software to include a loyalty program module.

These initiatives are tracked in Jira and are prioritized based on potential impact on merchant retention and revenue growth.
